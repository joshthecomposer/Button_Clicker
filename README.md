# Button Clicker
This is an assignment completed for Coding Dojo focused on practicing front-end JavaScript. It focused on setting innerText on button elements with functions. 
### Objectives:
* Change the text to say "Logout" when the "Login" button is clicked.
* Remove the Add Definition button when it is clicked
* Alert "Ninja was liked" when clicking a like button.
### Additional funcionality I added (For fun):
* I used `parseInt()` to grab the text of the like button, and iterated it up with each button click.
* I added a very brief `setTimeout` before the alert is executed so that the "likes" iterate before displaying the alert.
* I made the Logout / Login a switch that could go back and forth so that it can be clicked ad-infinitum.
